âœ… Problem Statement:
----------------------
You are given start and end times of N meetings. Only one meeting can be scheduled at a time in one room.
Return the **maximum number of meetings** that can be held without any overlap.

ðŸ”¸ Note: The end time of one meeting cannot be equal to the start time of another.

Example:
Input:
    start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]
    end[]   = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]

Output: 4
Explanation: Meetings (1,2), (3,4), (5,7), and (8,9) can be attended.

----------------------
âœ… Intuition:
This is a classic **Greedy Algorithm** problem:
- To maximize the number of non-overlapping meetings, always pick the meeting that finishes the earliest (i.e., sort by end time).
- Then, greedily select the next meeting whose start time is strictly **after** the last selected meetingâ€™s end time.

----------------------
âœ… Step-by-step Algorithm:
1. Pair each meeting's start and end times.
2. Sort the meetings by end time (to prioritize earlier finishing meetings).
3. Initialize `count = 1` (select the first meeting).
4. Iterate through remaining meetings:
   - If current meeting's start time > last selected meetingâ€™s end time, select it and increment count.
5. Return the final count.

----------------------
âœ… Time Complexity:
- O(n log n): For sorting the meetings based on end time.
- O(n): For iterating through meetings.

âœ… Space Complexity:
- O(n): For storing start-end pairs of meetings.
