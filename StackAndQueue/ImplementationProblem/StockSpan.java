/*
 * 901. Online Stock Span
 *
 * ‚úÖ Problem:
 * Implement the StockSpanner class that computes the **stock span** for each day.
 * The span of the stock's price today is the number of consecutive previous days
 * where the price was less than or equal to today's price.
 *
 * üí° Intuition: (Previous Greater Element to current element index - current index)
 * Use a stack to maintain prices along with their indices (or spans).
 * For each new price:
 *   - Pop all previous prices from the stack that are ‚â§ current price.
 *   - The span is the distance between the current day and the last day with a greater price.
 *   - Push the current price and its index onto the stack.
 *
 * üß† Algorithm:
 * 1. Maintain a stack of pairs (price, index).
 * 2. For each new price:
 *    a. Increment index.
 *    b. Pop from stack until top price is > current price.
 *    c. Calculate span = current index - top's index (or -1 if stack is empty).
 *    d. Push (price, index) to stack.
 *    e. Return span.
 *
 * ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity: Amortized O(1) per operation (since each element is pushed and popped once).
 * üóÉÔ∏è Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of calls to next().
