Problem: Aggressive Cows (Binary Search on Answer)

You are given an array of stall positions and a number 'k' representing the number of cows.
Place the cows in the stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.

Intuition:
- The optimal solution lies between 1 and the max possible distance (max - min of stalls).
- We use Binary Search on this answer range.
- For a mid value (potential distance), we check if we can place all k cows such that 
  each cow is at least `mid` distance apart.

Approach:
1. Sort the stall positions.
2. Use Binary Search between 1 and (last - first stall position).
3. For each mid, check if itâ€™s possible to place k cows with at least `mid` distance.
   - Greedily place cows by scanning the stalls and placing them as far apart as possible.
4. If possible, try to increase distance (move right).
5. Else, reduce the distance (move left).

Time Complexity: O(N log(max_dist))  
- N: number of stalls
- log(max_dist): binary search range

Space Complexity: O(1)
