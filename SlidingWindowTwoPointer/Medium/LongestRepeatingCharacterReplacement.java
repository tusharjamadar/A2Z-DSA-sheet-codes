424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

üß© Problem:
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you can replace at most `k` characters in the string to make the longest possible substring where all characters are the same. Return the length of such a substring.

üß† Intuition:
We want to find the **longest substring** in which we can convert at most `k` characters to make the entire substring consist of the same character.

The key observation is: in any window, if the number of characters we need to change = (window size - max frequency character count), 
and that is <= k, then the window is valid.

üß™ Dry Run:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Window: "AABA"
Frequencies: A=3, B=1 ‚Üí window size = 4, maxFreq = 3 ‚Üí changes = 1 ‚Üí valid
Window: "ABABB" ‚Üí A=2, B=3 ‚Üí window size = 5, maxFreq = 3 ‚Üí changes = 2 ‚Üí invalid ‚Üí shrink window from left

‚úÖ Algorithm (Sliding Window + Hash Array):
1. Use two pointers `left` and `right` to maintain a sliding window.
2. Track character frequencies in the window using a hash array of size 26.
3. Track the frequency of the most common character `maxFreq`.
4. While (window size - maxFreq) > k ‚Üí shrink window from left.
5. At each step, update the max length.

‚è± Time Complexity: O(n)
Only one pass through the string. Each character is visited at most twice.

üì¶ Space Complexity: O(26) ‚Üí O(1) constant space
