/*
‚úÖ Problem:
Implement the **Selection Sort** algorithm. The goal is to sort an array of integers in ascending order by repeatedly finding the minimum element and placing it in the correct position.

üß† Intuition:
Selection Sort works by selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm:
1. Iterate through the entire array.
2. For each iteration, find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.
3. Swap this minimum element with the first unsorted element.
4. Continue this until the array is sorted.

‚è± Time Complexity:
- **Best, Average, and Worst case**: O(n^2), because we have two nested loops (one for traversing the array and one for finding the minimum element).

üì¶ Space Complexity:
- O(1), as Selection Sort is an **in-place sorting algorithm**, requiring no additional space besides the input array.
