/*
‚úÖ Problem:
Implement the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. The goal is to sort an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort technique.

üß† Intuition:
Bubble sort works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements of the array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. After each pass through the array, the largest unsorted element will "bubble" up to its correct position. This process is repeated until no swaps are made, indicating that the array is sorted.

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm:
1. **Iterate** over the entire array, comparing each element with the next.
2. **Swap** the elements if they are in the wrong order.
3. After each pass, the largest unsorted element is placed at the end.
4. **Recursion (for Recursion version)**: The process is repeated recursively by reducing the size of the unsorted section.
5. **Early termination**: If no elements are swapped during a pass, the array is already sorted, and we can terminate early.

‚è± Time Complexity:
- **Best case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted (early termination).
- **Average and Worst case**: O(n^2), since for every element, we may need to compare it with all other elements in the array.

üì¶ Space Complexity:
- O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space (no additional data structures).
